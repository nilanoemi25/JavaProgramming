Chronology of my implementation (what I did first, etc.. )
00 Wrote up menu in driver as soon as the assignment was out
01 Read through everything 02  WD Class, Smart Band Class, SmartWatch Class
03 Did the whole API not just dummy code but wrote all the methods, without any assurance that any of it was correct
04 Driver Class was the hardest mostly because I discovered all the errors from the API methods. I focused on getting most things working and then returned to the bugs/errors that I knew were hidden in there. 

Main difficulties I came across in your development of solution and how I solved them.
I wasnt sure how to ADD SW and SB to the arraylist. I didnt know whether to pass an Obj in to the Add method as a parameter or to have the individual fields passed in to the ADD method. I tried both and went with the latter. At some point I had both because I have a different method for adding SW and SB, but I found that passing in the fields as params worked the best. I wasnt sure if having a separate method for adding SW and SB are correct but the only way I could get it to work. 
I noticed that I forgot about the unique ID requirement in the driver and only by chance as I was worked through saved data that I realised my ids were the same. I added in the validation last minute. 
I luckily knew the continue keyword from JS so I got around the manufacturer name 'null' error quite easily. 


Any bugs remaining in the solution or unfinished elements of spec (no need if you have detailed these in the rubric section) No bugs remain to my knowledge!!

Main learnings from my engagement with assignment
I was apprehensive about the driver for somereason but I feel better about it now in terms of having to call every single method from the API and having all the system.outs in the driver. All the sorting and searching labs went over my head I really only applied it in the assignment. 

Mandatory : PLease list any references used in your development/ implementation of your submission. 
Labs, slack, lecture notes. I remembered the continue keyword from JS. 
I think everything was well explained in lecture so there was no real need to go and reference other materials. 

Please consider the following statements and choose one (delete the inappropriate one)

- This is my work apart from the specific references noted above (and any code from class notes). I understand the code and can decribe any parts of the solution if needs be;
